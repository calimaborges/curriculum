work_history:
  -  P21
    - Mantained and evolved PHP application used by multiple brazilian institutes

      # P21's team was struggling to find a solution to sign and verify signatures using e-CPF (brazilian digital certificate).
      # When I joined, I developed a Java Applet for the client (frontend) and used OpenSSL to verify the signature (backend). 
      # The solution remained in use for years until Java Applet was discontinued.

      # After that, the manager always looked after me to solve the most challenging problems. The next challenge was to migrate
      # the application from a on-premise infrastrucutre to a brazilian virtual server provider. I was responsible for configuring 
      # all the MySQL databases and Linux servers. Back then I recommended a backup policy for the database and configured it.

      # My relation with the company remained for years after I left. I would eventually work as a freelancer. After a couple of years the manager contacted me 
      # and told that a developer had mistakenly dropped a database. I used the backup policy that I elaborated back then to restore the database to the exact state
      # right before the drop.

      As part of P21's team, I developed and maintained a PHP application used by multiple Brazilian institutes. The team was struggling to find a solution for signing and verifying signatures using e-CPF (Brazilian digital certificates), and I was able to develop a Java Applet for the client (frontend) and use OpenSSL for verification on the backend. This solution was in use for several years until Java Applet was discontinued.
      As the manager continued to rely on me to solve complex problems, the next challenge was to migrate the application from on-premises infrastructure to a Brazilian virtual server provider. I was responsible for configuring all the MySQL databases and Linux servers, and I also recommended and implemented a backup policy for the database.
      After I left the company, my relationship with them remained strong, and I occasionally worked as a freelancer. A couple of years later, the manager contacted me to inform that a developer had accidentally dropped a database. I was able to restore it to the exact state right before the drop using the backup policy that I had implemented.
